# Syntara

A multi-brand design system that humans and AI agents build with.

57 React Aria components, its own icon set, a server-driven UI schema and a docs site with live previews, all themed by an engine that turns six brand inputs into a light and dark theme passing WCAG 2.2 AA.

![One page switching between four brands and then to dark, with nothing differing in code](https://github.com/anujpatel06/strata/releases/download/readme-media/readme.gif)

<sub>29 seconds, unedited: Vela, Harbor, Qamar (Arabic — the layout mirrors), Haat (Devanagari), then dark. Same components, same code. Re-record with `pnpm gif`; the file is hosted on the <a href="https://github.com/anujpatel06/strata/releases/tag/readme-media">readme-media release</a> rather than committed, so it costs nothing to clone.</sub>

| Vela · neobank | Harbor · insurer | Qamar · grocery, Arabic RTL |

Same components, same code. A tenant differs by tokens + copy only. Screenshots: `pnpm screenshots`.

## What works today

- **57 components** (`@syntara/react`) on React Aria: fields, pickers, overlays, feedback, navigation and a DataTable. Every one works in light and dark, both densities, and RTL, and each has a `meta.json` that drives its docs page.
- **Docs site** (`apps/docs`, Next.js): component pages with live previews per tenant, scheme, direction and density; Blocks; Themes; Colors; ⌘K search. The site is themed by Syntara itself.
- **Distribution** (ADR-011): install `@syntara/react` and `@syntara/tokens` from npm — all eight packages are published at [0.1.0](https://www.npmjs.com/org/syntara) — or copy a component's source files into your project.
- **7 blocks**: dashboard, request flow, settings, sign-in, activity table, benefits overview and portfolio. Each runs in every tenant.
- **Governance** (`GOVERNANCE.md`): an RFC flow, a deprecation policy, and one deprecation carried out end to end. Button's `variant="danger"` became `tone="danger"`, with a codemod in `@syntara/codemods`.
- **`@syntara/icons`**: Syntara's own icon set (ADR-014).

Phase 1:

- **Brand Generator** — 6 inputs (primary, accent, neutral temperature, shape, type pair, density) → full theme, live preview, export. Runs in the browser.
- **OKLCH theme engine + contrast solver** — 12-step ramps, brand hex kept exact, every failing pair fixed and explained in plain English. Zero runtime dependencies.
- **Six tenants** — Vela, Harbor, Qamar (Arabic, right to left), Care, Haat (Hindi; its copy is a draft until a Hindi reader reviews it) and the house theme the site uses. A tenant is one `brand.json` + one `content.json`.
- **Exports** — CSS variables, DTCG 2025.10 JSON, Figma-variables JSON (Brand / Scheme / Density collections).

## Quick start

Node 22 and pnpm 10 (`corepack enable`).

```sh
pnpm i
pnpm docs           # docs site → http://localhost:3000 (components, blocks, themes)
pnpm dev            # Brand Generator → http://localhost:5173
pnpm test           # unit tests
pnpm test:themes    # fuzz random brand colours × light/dark, write a pass-rate report
pnpm tokens         # build every tenant's tokens into packages/tokens
pnpm screenshots    # Playwright: every tenant × scheme + axe report
```

## Repo map

docs/rfcs/               proposals, written before the change is built
docs/log.md              session log: changed / decided / next
GOVERNANCE.md            who decides, how a change gets in, deprecation policy
```

Coming: `/story` (Phase 6). The npm release shipped: `@syntara/react`, `tokens`, `theme-engine`, `icons`, `sdui`, `audit`, `mcp` and `codemods`, all at 0.1.0.

## Roadmap

- [x] **0 · Plan** — scaffold, ADR drafts
- [x] **1 · Tokens + engine + generator v0** — tiers, tenants, contrast solver + fuzz
- [x] **2 · Components** — components on React Aria, meta, accessibility, RTL, density
- [x] **3 · Docs site and blocks** — the docs site and its blocks stand in for the reference product and Storybook the brief planned
- [x] **4 · Governance** — GOVERNANCE, RFC flow, Changesets, one real deprecation + codemod
- [x] **5 · MCP + audit + eval** — MCP server, drift auditor, CI gate, per-model agent eval
- [ ] **5a · Mobile reach** — server-driven UI schema, native token export, Hindi tenant *(built, waiting for Anuj's review; no native components, and the Kotlin files haven't been compiled)*
- [ ] **6 · Publish** — npm, docs site, `/story` page

## Principles

1. **Tokens are the API.** Components use semantic/component tokens, never primitives.
2. **A brand is data, not code.** New tenant = one JSON file. Zero component changes.
3. **Accessible by construction.** A theme that fails WCAG 2.2 AA can't be generated or exported.
4. **Logical properties only.** RTL is free, not a retrofit.
5. **Design ↔ code parity.** Every Figma property maps 1:1 to a React prop.
6. **One source of truth for humans and agents.** Docs, MCP and Figma read one `meta.json`.
7. **Make the right thing the easy thing.** Every finding suggests the exact fix.
