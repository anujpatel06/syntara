 * where a whole page only has to be recognisable.
 *
 * The still is a picture of the page the card links to, so it is hidden from assistive tech and inert: no tab stops
 * and no pointer events inside it, and the card's title link stays the card's one target.
 *
 * It mounts only once the card is near the viewport. Fifty-three of these share this page, and an example that has
 * not mounted has not fetched its chunk. Nothing renders on the server either — the still is decorative, and every
 * card reads without it.
