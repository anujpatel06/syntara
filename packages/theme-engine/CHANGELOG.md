# @syntara/theme-engine

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 9ee91af: Button gets `tone`, and `variant="danger"` is deprecated (RFC-001, ADR-021).

  - react: `<Button tone="danger">` on the `primary`, `outline` and `ghost` variants. `variant="danger"` keeps working and renders the same until 1.0.0; it warns once in development. Migrate with `npx @syntara/codemods button-variant-danger-to-tone <path>`. CSS that targets `[data-variant='danger']` keeps working until 1.0.0; change it to `[data-tone='danger']` before then.
  - theme-engine: the four `feedback.*.fg` roles are now solved against `surface.canvas` and `surface.raised` as well (118 contrast checks per brand, was 102). No token value changed: the new pairs already passed in every tenant.
  - codemods: new package, with `button-variant-danger-to-tone`.

- 820c317: Dark mode keeps the light-mode label on solid fills (primary, accent, feedback). When the light label fails in dark, the dark fill moves by up to ΔL 0.12 (deeper for white, lighter for ink), logged as a `choice` adjustment. Pure red now gets `#ec0000` with white labels in both schemes. `resolveRoles` takes an optional third argument, the light-mode roles. (ADR-006)
- a859d16: Line heights are measured per type pair, and no glyph's ink leaves its line box

  Six of the nine type pairs now carry their own line heights, measured with `scripts/check-script-clipping.mjs`
  rather than sharing a scale chosen for Latin. Both Arabic pairs were cutting fully vowelled text by up to 12px, and
  four Latin pairs were cutting descenders. Across 42,768 rendered cases — every size, weight, DPR and sub-pixel
  offset the script tests — nothing clips now, down from 5,209 cases.

  | Pair                                   | tight | snug | normal |
  | -------------------------------------- | ----- | ---- | ------ |
  | `bilingual-round`, `bilingual-classic` | 1.8   | 1.8  | 1.9    |
  | `friendly`                             | 1.35  | 1.4  | 1.5    |
  | `editorial`, `calm`, `technical`       | 1.3   | 1.35 | 1.5    |

  `precise` and `modern` clipped nothing and are unchanged, as is `bilingual-devanagari` (already measured in ADR-020).

  **What changes for you:** if your brand uses one of the six, `--syntara-line-height-*` are larger and text is taller.
  Arabic is noticeably airier. The CSS, DTCG and Figma exports carry the new values; the shadcn export is unaffected,
  because it emits no line heights. No colour, no contrast result and no other token changed.

  `ScriptTypeTokens.name` widens from `'devanagari'` to `'devanagari' | 'arabic' | 'latin'`, and `minFontSize` and
  `capsTracking` are now optional so a pair can override line height alone. This is additive for anyone reading the
  type; a switch over `name` that assumed a single value will need the new cases.

  `@syntara/react` also re-exports `useLocale` from `theme-scope`, so components that need the scope's locale no longer
  have to reach into `react-aria-components` directly.

- 320a45c: Phase 5: the drift auditor, the MCP server and brand fidelity (ADR-018, ADR-022).

  - audit: new package. `syntara-audit <path>` finds raw colours, off-scale sizes, written-out fonts, native elements, physical properties, missing accessible names and deprecated APIs. It scores 0–100, suggests a fix for every finding, and `--fix` applies the ones with a single right answer.
  - mcp: new package. A read-only MCP server with seven tools: `list_components`, `get_component`, `get_example`, `get_tokens`, `find_token`, `get_pattern` and `audit_snippet`. It serves `AGENTS.md` and `GOVERNANCE.md` as resources.
  - theme-engine: `brandFidelity(theme)` reports how far each brand fill is from the colour the brand asked for.
  - tokens: each tenant's `contrast-report.json` includes brand fidelity.

- 3a42138: Phase 5a: a server-driven UI contract, native token files and a Hindi type pair (ADR-019, ADR-020, ADR-023, ADR-024, ADR-025).

  - sdui: new package. A JSON Schema per component, generated from `meta.json`; `validateScreen`; and `SyntaraScreen`, a reference renderer for the web. 26 node types. Inputs, overlays, tables and charts aren't on the wire yet.
  - theme-engine: `toCompose` and `toSwiftUI` exporters. A new type pair, `bilingual-devanagari` (Mukta), with line heights and tracking set by measurement. The Figma export gains `font/lineHeight`.
  - tokens: each tenant gets `android/SyntaraTokens.kt` and `ios/SyntaraTokens.swift`. The build re-checks every contrast pair on the exported values. The Swift files are type-checked against the macOS SDK; the Kotlin files have not been compiled.
  - mcp: new tool `find_icon`. `get_component` returns `imports` and `typeNotes`.

- e17f88a: v0.3 craft pass.

  - theme-engine: motion (spring, easing-out, slow), glass solved for text contrast, rim and glow, hairline, size-matched tracking, caps tracking, icon stroke, display sizes, rounder radii, a chart palette solver checked for colour blindness, `editorial` and `modern` type pairs, a `paper` neutral, and 98 contrast pairs per brand.
  - react: tactile motion across components; new Sidebar, IconTile, Eyebrow, Amount, Meter, Tag, PersonChip, AreaChart/LineChart, BarChart, Sparkline and chart toolkit; Card `feature`/`inset`/`rim`; Button `contrast`; Badge `status`; soft-outline fields with sm/md/lg sizes; icons from `@syntara/icons`.
  - icons: new package, 235 icons.
  - tokens: ships `dist` (`files`).

### Patch Changes

- 205de82: Every published package now carries its own `LICENSE`, a `repository` entry pointing at its directory, `homepage`
  and `bugs`. `@syntara/react` and `@syntara/tokens` build on `prepack`, so a tarball can no longer ship a stale
  `dist`. `@syntara/react`, `@syntara/icons` and `@syntara/theme-engine` have READMEs, which are what npm shows.
