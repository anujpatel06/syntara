/**
 * The README's "Tests" row must match what `pnpm test` reports, package for package.
 *
 * It counts each package's TOTAL, not its passing count, because the passing count is not the same on every
 * machine: `native-exporters.test.ts` type-checks the Swift export against the macOS SDK and skips off a Mac,
 * with a complementary test that skips on one. The suite is 310 either way; 309 pass on a Mac and 308 on Linux
 * CI, so a row of passing counts can only ever be right on one of them. Nothing failing is asserted separately,
 * below, so "310 engine" still means 310 tests and no failures.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-test-counts.mjs                  run `pnpm -r test`, then check the row against it
 *   node scripts/check-test-counts.mjs --from FILE       check against saved `pnpm test` output (CI runs the
 *                                                        suite once and pipes it to a file)
 *   node scripts/check-test-counts.mjs --from -          the same, reading stdin
 *   node scripts/check-test-counts.mjs --fix             rewrite the row with the measured numbers
 *
 * Why: the row inside the `numbers:` markers is maintained by hand — the table has no generator, and each row
 * carries the command that reproduces it. Its parts and their total then live in two places that nothing compares.
 * On 2026-09-30 the row read `468 components · 301 engine · 245 icons · …` (1,439) while the suite had been at
 * 2,167 for weeks, and `docs/log.md` had recorded 2,167 correctly in the meantime. Nobody was wrong at the moment
 * they wrote it; the row just went stale between sessions, which is what the "No invented metrics" rule in
 * CLAUDE.md is there to stop.
 *
 * What it checks:
 *   1. every package whose tests ran appears in the row, and every part of the row names a package that ran;
 *   2. each part equals that package's passing count;
 *   3. the parts sum to the suite's total, which is the number `docs/log.md` quotes.
 * `pnpm` prints no grand total, so the total here is the sum of the per-package counts — the same sum a person
 * does by hand. Check 3 is therefore implied by 1 and 2; it is reported because it is the number that gets quoted.
 *
 * `--fix` writes the counts and nothing else. In particular it does not touch the "Measured" date under the table:
 * that date covers every row, and only a run of every row's command earns it.
